# About - In Progress

Hello! I'm David Silva :) I'm Brazilian and I'm based in SÃ£o Paulo.

I'm working, studying and having fun technology since 2010.

In my routine have music and some coffee, like the most of developers I guess. Sometimes some Brazilian musics, sometimes some LoFi to keep concentration and variated styles.
I like read some book, currently more books about some old filosophy but also I like the self improvement books and business.

My first work with technology was as a teen boy, I learn about Hardware and the basic of network, changing hard disks, memories, CPU, GPU, etc. And setting up some DHCP, DNS and IP's in Windows machines.
With some years more, with 16y, I started some professional courses about Linux Servers and Network Administration. Was awesome for me life. Maybe my best first decision, was a lot of expensive but I payed with my self work.

To be continue soon...
