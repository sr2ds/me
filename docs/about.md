# About - In Progress

Hello! I'm David Silva :) I'm Brazilian and I'm based in SÃ£o Paulo.

I've been working, studying, and having fun with technology since I was 13.

In my routine have music and some coffee, like the most of developers I guess. Sometimes some Brazilian musics, sometimes some LoFi to keep concentration and variated styles.
I like read some book, currently more books about some old filosophy but also I like the self improvement books and business.

My first work with technology was as a teen boy, I learned about Hardware and the basic of network, changing hard disks, memories, CPU, GPU, etc. And setting up some DHCP, DNS and IP's in Windows machines.
With some years more, with 16y, I started some professional courses about Linux Servers and Network Administration. Was awesome for me life. Maybe my best first decision, was a lot of expensive but maybe my first life change.

After that, working as Support Analyst and SysAdmin, I studied somethings about Project Management and Operations (like ITIL, COBIT, PMI, etc) and this studies and experience help me to open my mind to more things with technology and business world. In this moment, around 2014, I decided learn other things and grow-up more. I decided learn software development stuff and then started.

To be continue soon... I'm doing it bit for year. If you rush, check my LinkedIn.
